Tune in to today’s episode of Version One, a podcast about the product development journey from the makers behind some of the web’s most talked about tools and resources with host, Maurice Cherry.

Today’s guest is the co-founder and CEO of Webflow, a visual development platform that provides designers with the tools they need to create powerful web pages without needing to write code. Today’s guest is Vlad Magdalin. 

The episode opens with Maurice providing some background on the success of Webflow, stating that as of today, they’ve accumulated over 2 million users, and over 100,000 customers spanning across 210 countries. Powerhouse companies such as Dell, Upwork, and Zendesk have all utilized Webflow to maintain their website design and online marketing.  

To fully understand how Vlad has gotten to where he is today, Maurice asks about his early career and education. Vlad reveals how he got his start by helping his parents with ad and business card design when they first came to the United States as refugees in 1991. He explains how his father began to build his own business and assigned Vlad to work on various graphic design tasks using platforms such as Illustrator and Photoshop. 

Vlad goes on to share how his formal education in web design did not take the traditional course. Starting out at California Polytechnic State University studying computer science, he left to enroll in San Francisco’s Academy of Art University seeking a more creative educational foundation. When the program fell short of Vlad’s expectations, he returned to Cal Poly to finish out his computer science degree. This combination of Vlad’s technological and creative interests played a major role in his development of Webflow.

Vlad shares how freelancing for a wide variety of clients with a wide variety of needs over the years allowed him to see where the web design industry could be improved. With the desire to put creativity back in the control of creative-minded people, Vlad began building Webflow with the goal of creating a visual development environment that would empower individuals to build applications visually rather than through the traditional methods of writing code. 

Vlad’s journey was not without its highs and lows however, and he shares how there were a number of obstacles and false starts he encountered over the years including challenges to secure investors and how best to garner interest from the public. In this episode, Vlad details how slowing down, and a shift in mindset and approach, allowed Webflow to grow a waitlist of thousands of users before the product was even fully formed. 

Maurice concludes the episode by asking Vlad if he has any parting words of wisdom for listeners. You won’t want to miss this, as Vlad reveals his final piece of advice as to how web development companies can best create longevity and satisfaction within their customer base.
