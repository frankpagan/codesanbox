Vlad Magdalin:
Finally, we decided to post to Hacker News, which we thought was such a long shot, and this demo took off like wildfire.

Maurice Cherry:
This is Version One, a podcast from CodeSandbox about the product development journey of some of the web's most talked about tools and resources from the makers behind them. I'm your host, Maurice Cherry. Webflow empowers designers worldwide to build professional custom websites in a completely visual canvas with no code. They have over 2 million users and over 100,000 customers across 210 countries. Companies including Dell, Upwork, Zendesk and Rakuten depend on Webflow to help their marketing and design teams create production ready, easy to maintain websites. To get a sense of how Webflow came to be, you have to know about it's CEO and co-founder Vlad Magdalin. Let's see how his life and early career as a designer helped influence the creation of this revolutionary platform. The year is 1991, the Chicago Bulls won their first NBA championship, Beavis and ButtHead premiered on MTV. The Soviet Union also dissolved this year, the same year Vlad and his family left there and came to the United States as refugees.

Vlad Magdalin:
My parents didn't speak the language, we were on welfare for a while as my parents were trying to take night classes and figure out how to learn English. And my dad had to learn some new trades and trying to make ends meet on the side. One of the things that he realized was a big opportunity was, in the United States there was something called PVC pipes. These are pipes that are made of plastic, and they're really easy to work with and much more versatile than what we had in Russia, which was just like lead pipe basically. He decided to make an import-export business or try to create one. And part of that was taking materials from here and finding clients in Russia and getting them to order them, and shipping them over.

Vlad Magdalin:
But to do that, you had to make catalogs that were in Russian, and this is something my dad tasked me with. He somehow got his hands on CorelDRAW, which was the early precursor to illustrator and Figma. And he gave me a job. It was like pre high school, I think I was in middle school, to scan and trace these pipe diagrams and translate everything from English to Russian. So that's where I started to learn graphic design, just because it was something that my dad needed me to do. Ultimately that business didn't work out as much, you have to have a bunch of connections, but through that process I learned really how to use the graphic design tools. I would make business cards and ad designs, because I was one of these kids that was in a church community that knew how to use CorelDRAW and Photoshop, and go after school and work at this print shop.

Vlad Magdalin:
Basically they had this yellow pages product that they put out, and that really taught me to become a designer where I learned (like) what good looks like and got me interested in that creative path. And in the meantime, I started to see opportunities right as I was finishing high school, like I could combine this graphic design aspect of making really nice looking designs and trying to learn HTML and CSS. This is early days of Dreamweaver when the web was starting to become a thing, but it was still seen for a lot of businesses, like a novelty or more of like a brochure, not something that is like a core piece of your marketing. That's when I really started working on freelancing on the side, to find clients and do little websites for them. But that didn't really pick up more earnestly like in the market in general, where people just saw websites as more than toys until my earlier college days.

Maurice Cherry:
Vlad's older brother ended up attending California Polytechnic State University, Cal Poly for short. And he got into the computer science program there, but Vlad didn't want to follow that path. He applied to around a dozen or so different schools and decided to go to the Rochester Institute of Technology, RIT. His parents though had other plans.

Vlad Magdalin:
My parents were barely making it, everything about college would have had to be loans or grants or things like that. So they said like, "We just can't afford to fly you out there." And I couldn't get a full scholarship, so they said, "Basically you have to go to school where your brother goes to school, because we're already driving him there every few months, he has a place there." I went to Cal Poly and I hated it so much, I really hated computer science, it was just not my jam at the time. And after about nine months I decided to drop out.

Maurice Cherry:
I know that feeling. When I went to college, I dual majored in computer science and computer engineering, and told my advisor at the time that I wanted to do web design. He told me that the internet was just a fad, which sounds crazy but this was the late '90s or early two 2000s. And I ended up changing majors because like Vlad, computer science was not my jam either. Vlad ended up moving to San Francisco and enrolled in the Academy of Art University.

Vlad Magdalin:
At the time, I just felt really strongly about it because my dream had become over those nine months, struggling with trying to learn how to program and learn computer science. My dream had become like, how do I get back into my creative roots? And the thing that made the most sense to me at the time was trying to work at Pixar. Like how do I get a job at Pixar where I can work on these movies that look so incredible and have this realism to them. And that's what drew me to go to art school, wanting to learn visual effects and 3D animation et cetera. What the school actually ended up being was A, a money pit of student loan debt, B, like no classes in 3D animation. It was like two years of learning the classic stuff, like sculpting color theory, perspective, hand-drawn animation.

Vlad Magdalin:
I spent two years doing that, going really into debt. By the time I took my first 3D animation class, in the beginning of the third year, I realized how bad the school's program was at the time, where my teacher was essentially a student who was using a book that was like five years old. They didn't actually know the product we're trying to learn Maya. They were going through with that set of tutorials, and it was somebody that couldn't get a job in industry. So it was this realization of, am I wasting my time? And combined with the fact that, a lot of people who had recently graduated from the school were having trouble finding jobs.Just randomly one day when I was still in art school, I ordered this book on ASP.net, to learn how to create a web application, because there was a product that my friends and I were using called, I forget what it's called at this point, like Quick dot or something like that.

Vlad Magdalin:
It was all about like asynchronous group chat, and I decided to build something like that just because my friends and I were using it. And I was like, "Hey, maybe I can create this application." That's where I started really falling in love with programming again. I was like, "Hey, now it's not just like this theoretical exercise around computer science theory and proofs and learning the structures of programming languages." It was actually something that you could do to create a product out of thin air. Like you write this code, it becomes real, people can use it, you bring it to life. That's when I decided to drop out of art school and moved back to Cal Poly and finish working on my computer science degree.

Maurice Cherry:
This application Vlad created was called Chatterfox. It allowed people to easily stay in touch with groups of friends, family, or coworkers. Think of it as the pre-web 2.0 equivalent to WhatsApp. Vlad worked on Chatterfox for a number of years while still attending Cal Poly. And during that time, he interned at a local design agency to help make ends meet while also paying off that art school student loan debt.

Vlad Magdalin:
My entire role was to take designs from the design department, and they had a really creative and awesome design department, and write the HTML & CSS, and a little bit of SQL to make their designs real in the companies or in this agency's proprietary CMS system. And initially I was seeing it as like, all right, I'm just going to get this job, I'm going to clock in, do the code to translate these designs and clock out. Because that's what everybody else was doing. Not even a few weeks later, I just saw how frustrating that entire process was, not just for me, but mostly for all the creative folks. I was being paid like minimum wage at the time to do this internships/translation.

Vlad Magdalin:
And I saw this invoice where it was over a hundred thousand dollars for the work that I would do in the course of a week or two, for that translation there. And that included the design part as well, but it really struck me like, "Hey, the thing that this small team of designers and small team of developers creating, is worth so much to these businesses. Yet it's so inefficient the way that it's working." And immediately, I thought back to how the 3D animation and visual effects industry works. And there you have way less of that translation.

Maurice Cherry:
Vlad is about to have a breakthrough.

Vlad Magdalin:
I mean, there's many skills involved there but, nobody is doing the translation from the creative work to the real production work, and that combination of seeing, "Hey, wow, there's people are willing to pay so much for this work. And I've seen this much better way in this similar creative discipline where the creative people are put into a much more closer proximity to the final work that is delivered to customers that why can't something like that exist for web development?"

Vlad Magdalin:
I was like, "Hey, if we create something that is similar to 3D animation and modeling software, but for web design and web creation and remove this middle translation layer, we can actually put a lot more power and a lot more creativity into the hands of creative people and remove a ton of this friction in the middle." And it's so freaking valuable, like just seeing from what businesses are willing to pay for this stuff that I'm sure will give creative a lot of economic opportunity if we were to create a product like that. So that's when the original idea for Webflow came to be, and I started working on it on the side, before I even finished college. I ended up writing my senior project on Webflow on the entire topic of creating this visual development environment to empower creative people to build applications visually instead of writing code directly. And then that started the journey of multiple failures and false starts to try to get that product off the ground over the years.

Maurice Cherry:
Now, that's dedication. When we return, Vlad goes through the highs and lows of taking Webflow to the next level. Welcome back. Webflow was starting to take shape, but Vlad definitely went through some trial and error before establishing the Webflow that you and I know of today.

Vlad Magdalin:
Initially the idea was for a product, it was kind of the big dream, imagining the products that exist in 3D animation land, and just knowing that there has to be a better way for web application development too, but the multiple attempts at trying to start it and build it as a product, that gave up multiple times, it's going to be too hard to build this product by myself. I started working on it more on as a services plus product thing. How do I build a product by freelancing on the side? And building more and more complex sites for clients. And over time, add more to the secret product I'm building in the background. And eventually hopefully have something that can build more and more, like a higher and higher percentage of like the projects that I'm taking on as a freelancer. Eventually it will turn into a full fledged product.

Maurice Cherry:
This method was a bit of a double-edged sword. The variety of clients meant ending up with lots of potential features, but only specific use cases.

Vlad Magdalin:
I have this client that is a snowboard manufacturer. They need like e-commerce and design customization, and this other customer that's like a newspaper. So they need like tons of different content, and a lot of collaboration features. So both of those things in isolation, but then I would get another client that's like a dentist, they needed a simple design, and the product wasn't capable of yet. I had to do all that manually. So there are drawbacks to that even though over time, it helped me understand more and more what the core functionality of a more mass applicable product would be.

Maurice Cherry:
Building initial traction for Webflow was a little difficult, mainly because this wasn't Vlad's first time trying to get this idea off the ground.

Vlad Magdalin:
So there were like three other times that I incorporated Webflow, before this current one. And none of those times really had any real traction. So two of those times I was just by myself, I never really launched any sort of product outside of having clients that were unbeknownst to them using it on the back end. And then one of those times I tried to start, this was 2007, 2008 with a couple coworkers at Intuit where we actually got some funding, but this last iteration starting in 2012, the traction we had early was like, again, unbeknownst to anybody. Was just clients, Sergey, my brother and I who ended up being one of my co-founders. We just kept doing these client projects on the side where we would find a client, he would do the design.

Vlad Magdalin:
I would implement it in this sort of hack together version of Webflow. In the background, that was sort of mixed in with WordPress and then launched that site for them. But then we realized that wasn't going to scale, we actually had to build a product from the ground up, and we had to focus on things that were just table stakes. That would be something that is totally different than anything that exists at the time. And what we realized this was late 2012, that the thing that nobody had really cracked during that time was responsive design

Maurice Cherry:
Vlad had picked a pretty thorny issue to try and solve with Webflow. But this ended up being a breakthrough. He started from scratch in this new direction with renewed enthusiasm, but ran into more issues along the way.

Vlad Magdalin:
We initially thought that we're going to show this product off, and everyone's going to knock down our doors and everyone's going to ditch like Dreamweaver or code, et cetera. And we even paid to do this pretty expensive Kickstarter video to sort of explain the concept at the last minute, after draining almost 12 or $13,000 into that process, we found out that Kickstarter doesn't allow for hosted products or hosted services. It either has to be downloadable, or it has to be a physical product that you ship to somebody. So it was complete wasted effort, we thought we're going to get a bunch of traction that way. And then we try to apply to YC, and got rejected because it was mostly just the concept and a small little video where we could demo what it would be. But it wasn't enough to show that there was anybody really interested in it.

Vlad Magdalin:
Six months later, we had no cash going into personal debt at this point, taking out credit card loans and still didn't have a product. Sergey and I sat down and did the math on how long it would take us given our product development speed at that time, to actually launch the product in a usable way where people can sign up, they can create one page, they could publish that page, et cetera. And we knew that that was going to be at least another year.

Maurice Cherry:
Another year. That just wasn't time that Vlad and Sergey had to make this sustainable, especially after so many other setbacks. They had even considered going back to their former jobs so they could continue developing Webflow on the side. After a month and a half of deliberating, they came up with a solution.

Vlad Magdalin:
We decided to really scope things down and create not a product, but what we call the Playground, and you can actually still see it today, it's on playground.webflow.com. If you go there you'll see the original thing that we built as the demo. It's usable so you could see the idea, but it's not an actual product. You can't create a page with it, you can only do some light tweaks. And then when you refresh, they're all gone. It's more of an idea, we made that call because we had no other choice. We just didn't have the time or runway to be able to build a full product.

Maurice Cherry:
They posted the demo on Reddit, on Digg, and on design forums, but it just didn't get the feedback they needed.

Vlad Magdalin:
Finally, we decided to post Hacker News, which we thought was such a long shot, because here we are creating a product that's meant to abstract away code, and get people to write less code. We're posting it in a forum where it's mostly coders and hackers and people who write code for a living. And this demo took off like wildfire. That's really the first time that we got anything that we would call as traction. It wasn't actually people using the product per se, it was just people signing up. We had this lead capture form that said, "Hey, when we have an actual product, putting your email, we'll let you know when we launch something."

Vlad Magdalin:
Having a bunch of signups on a waiting list was enough to go back to Y Combinator and other startup accelerators and say like, "Hey, we have some idea of traction." That was enough to get a small bit of investment from Y Combinator and that's when we got to work to building an actual product that people could sign up, and log in, and create an account and actually create a webpage and publish it et cetera. But that didn't happen until about a year after we started. It really was that influx of interest around people signing up for a waiting list, that provided a lot of the traction, that kept us going.

Maurice Cherry:
Never underestimate the power of a good email list. After the break, Webflow, Version One. We're back. Vlad has persevered through a number of obstacles and challenges to get Webflow out into the world. That drive was brought on by a change in mindset.

Vlad Magdalin:
What we launched at first, we felt it was nowhere even close to Version One. We had this idea in our minds that, why would anybody on this waitlist pay us for a product that doesn't have basic features like blogging? Or basic features like being able to add a homepage and an about page, or basic features like a contact form. We didn't have any of those things. Our idea was that when we have some level of feature parody with like a Squarespace or a WordPress, that's when we have a Version One. What YC helped us understand, they actually like in a really painful way, they're like, "You need to launch, and you need to charge something in the next three months. Otherwise you're breaking the spirit of the entire program."

Vlad Magdalin:
For us, we were so embarrassed to launch and to start charging for a product that didn't have all those things that we thought had to be part of V1. We're just so convinced that nobody was going to pay for it. And to a certain degree, we were kind of right, because we had this massive wait list of 30,000 people or so that said like, "Hey, I'm interested in what you guys are building." And when we launched we thought, for sure we were going to convert a very significant portion of those people, but when we launched, it was like some dismal sub percent of 1% that actually converted to paying customers. Here's the thing, that was like the best decision we ever made.

Maurice Cherry:
For their customers, Webflow was perfect for what they needed right now. Personally Webflow helped me land a lot of client work back when I ran my own studio, because it just made building components so easy and the code was clean and readable, it just worked. Vlad listened to his customers and continued improving Webflow. That slowly started expanding into more functionality.

Vlad Magdalin:
And it wasn't until late 2015, that we launched our CMS. This is like two and a half years later, which is what I originally would have called a V1. That was a huge learning for me. It was like, there's more value to what you might be building, what you might realize, you really can only learn that from users. And it's almost unfair to keep that value away from people because you're trying to work on something that you believe is even bigger.

Maurice Cherry:
Any final words Vlad?

Vlad Magdalin:
Deliver customer value sooner, I think we've made that mistake too often where we wait like a year to launch something, because together it all makes sense. But we have this story in our heads that, the smaller parts of it are less valuable, and we learn over and over as you have them, if you put them into users’ hands, into customers’ hands, they actually benefit from it a lot more than you think.
