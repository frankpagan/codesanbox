This week, host Sara Vieira talks with Elizabet Oliveira, a senior product designer at Elastic. Listen as Elizabet talks about her journey from being a musician to working in tech, the value of design systems, and how open source projects helped her career."

Welcome to The CodeSandbox Podcast with host Sara Vieira, a frontend developer
at CodeSandbox. CodeSandbox is an online code editor that assists developers in
creating projects and apps both quickly and collaboratively.

In this episode, Sara is joined by Elizabet Oliveira, a Product Designer for
Elastic. The two talk about what makes a good design system, open source, and
what Elizabet has learned from the industry over the years.

One thing listeners will find unique is Elizabet was introduced to design
through her work as a musician in Portugal. She would make websites, design
flyers, and use other marketing practices to promote herself. When the financial
crisis hit Portugal around 2010, Elizabet found she needed to pivot in her
career and focus on web and web design. After all, she and her friends knew she
had a true artistic talent in design.

Elizabet then talks about her experiences at different companies before Elastic.
She mentions when she first worked her way up to Jr. Designer, she was initially
focused on wanting to impress her superiors and show her skills; however, over
time she learned that good design revolved more around accessibility and
accessible UX.

When asked about her experiences in open sourcing, Elizabet tells she has come
to like how it works. She notes that the “ease of collaboration” as a big factor
as to why likes it. Elizabet also explains that she uses CodeSandbox when
handling demos that have JS—and she especially uses CodeSandbox when it comes to
efficiently sharing UI patterns on Slack to other coworkers.
