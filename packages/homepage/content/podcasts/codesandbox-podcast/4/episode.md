description: "As new web technologies emerge and evolve, sometimes the best way to learn is to take a hands-on approach. No one knows this better than our guest for this episode, Kent C. Dodds. 

Kent is a JavaScript software engineer and full-time web development educator who has taught hundreds of thousands of people how to make the world a better place with quality software. We talked about his transition into working for himself, his philosophies behind teaching and learning, and how he balances and maintains all the educational content he creates."

Welcome to The CodeSandbox Podcast with host Sara Vieira, a frontend developer at
CodeSandbox. CodeSandbox is an online code editor that assists developers in creating projects
and apps both quickly and collaboratively. In each episode, tune in to hear discussions with
knowledgeable developers on everything from developer relations to project building, as we
provide listeners with valuable insight to help improve their own technical and creative skills.

Today on The CodeSandbox Podcast, host Sara Vieira sits down with Kent C. Dodds, a
Javascript Software Engineer and a full time web development educator, speaking with over one
hundred thousand people on how to make the world a better place with quality software.
To begin, we get a look into Kent’s life. He is a husband, father and full-time educator. His
teaching includes subjects like testing, react and javascript on several different platforms. He
considers himself a fiscally conservative, weary of taking big financial risks. By the time he
finally left his prior position at PayPal to be a full time educator, the transition felt obvious and
secure and allowed him ample family time.

Then, Sara asks Kent to disclose his trajectory into the world of tech. He began in a position
converting movie files into YouTube videos. His first experience with programming was building
a program which automatically ripped the DVDs and links and uploaded them. Building an open
source program is what landed Kent his first job and made him known in the JavaScript
community.

To avoid a burnout, Kent maintains focus on only projects that excite and motivate him. His
ultimate goal is to create things that people will remember, because if an idea is easily forgotten,
it is worthless. He spends much time pondering the retention of his teachings. He then speaks of
the emotional struggles he experiences regarding pacing.

Kent’s largest courses are on the platforms Epic React and Testing JavaScript. In addition, he has
many free courses available. EpicReact can be compared to a university semester-long, three
credit course, its length and cohesion setting the course apart from other current virtual
educators. Kent also runs a popular blog and several podcasts. He explains how he has been able
to make information engaging and long lasting. He is dedicated to transparency and even has a
page on his website disclosing his income sources.
