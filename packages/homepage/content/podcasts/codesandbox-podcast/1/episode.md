description: "On this first episode of The CodeSandbox Podcast, we're looking at prototyping. Prototyping allows you to test ideas earlier, iterate more, and create better products. Whether it's a static website, a component, or a full-stack web app, prototyping is extremely important when it comes to project development.

Our guest this week is Charlie Gerard, senior front-end developer at Netlify and author of Practical Machine Learning in JavaScript. We'll talk with her about machine learning, tech talks, and the process behind prototyping for side projects."

Welcome to The CodeSandbox Podcast with host Sara Vieira, a frontend developer
at CodeSandbox. CodeSandbox is an online code editor that assists developers in
creating projects and apps both quickly and collaboratively. In each episode,
tune in to hear discussions with knowledgeable developers on everything from
developer relations to project building, as we provide listeners with valuable
insight to help improve their own technical and creative skills.

Today on The CodeSandbox Podcast, host Sara Vieira sits down with senior
frontend developer at Netlify, public speaker, and author of Practical Machine
Learning in JavaScript, Charlie Gerard. Recorded on International Women’s Day,
Sara begins the interview by asking Charlie about how she initially got started
in prototyping, a field that Charlie describes as traditionally being portrayed
as “for the boys.” After taking a 12 week intensive boot camp course where
Charlie quickly learned the basics of coding, there was no going back. She
immediately fell in love with project creation and shares the story of the first
app she ever made and how she went above and beyond to add special effects to a
seemingly simple assignment. To this day, this app remains one of the most fun
pieces Charlie feels she has ever created. Sara then inquires about Charlie’s
creative process and where she derives her inspiration from. Charlie answers
this question by outlining what her goal is every time she takes on a new idea.
Rather than aiming for the app to be used by millions of people, Charlie asks
herself, “Can I make this idea work and how?” Motivated by a fierce thirst for
learning, if Charlie feels excited about an idea, she knows she’s on the right
path and knows she’s completed the project when she’s able to answer her initial
question. Above all, Charlie stresses that the work should not feel like work.
If the idea feels forced or laborious, she knows the idea may not have much
longevity to it if it doesn’t keep her interest.

The conversation then shifts to Charlie’s recent work in machine learning and
other mind controlled applications where the technology is able to sense the
user’s thoughts. In an effort to make machine learning accessible and
understandable to JavaScript developers of all skill levels, Charlie has
dedicated tireless time, effort, and energy into creating a book that uses
inclusive and encouraging language. On the topic of tips for others, Sara and
Charlie then discuss their experience having given TED Talks in the past.
Charlie provides insight to listeners on everything from how to overcome the
fear of public speaking, where to seek valuable feedback from an audience, and
how to get started in the world of conferences and meetups. Charlie believes
there are many benefits to hosting with CodeSandbox and there is no shortage of
tips, insight, and action steps packed into today’s episode. To further connect
