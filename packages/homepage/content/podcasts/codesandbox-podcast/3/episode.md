description: "Collaboration, especially when it comes to coding environments, can be really tricky. How do you make it so that people can work together easily, whether it's asynchronously or in real time? This week on The CodeSandbox Podcast, we're talking to someone who knows all about collaboration. 

Our guest is John Lindquist, co-founder of Egghead.io. We talked with him about how we went from creating video tutorials on YouTube to building the entire platform that is Egghead today. John also shared how he onboards new instructors, collaborates with developers, and gave us a preview of his latest project."

Welcome to The CodeSandbox Podcast with host Sara Vieira, a frontend developer
at CodeSandbox. CodeSandbox is an online code editor that assists developers in
creating projects and apps both quickly and collaboratively. In each episode,
tune in to hear discussions with knowledgeable developers on everything from
developer relations to project building, as we provide listeners with valuable
insight to help improve their own technical and creative skills.

Today on The CodeSandbox Podcast, host Sara Vieira sits down with John
Lindquist, instructor and co-founder of the educational platform for developers
of all levels, Egghead.io. Sara begins today’s interview by asking John about
the trajectory of his career and how he found his way to web development
instruction. It’s clear from the start that John possessed a passion for content
creation, saying that he started out on his own making videos to help users
utilize JavaScript. Over the years he has worked with major companies across
various industries such as Disney, Target, HBO, as well as the Air Force to help
agencies build the strongest of web apps. Shifting away from the marketing
realm, John reveals how he then segued into work as a developer advocate. When
asked about what value John gained from this area of the industry, he explains
how he was able to develop his public speaking skills and further understand how
best to relate to an audience that would regularly approach him to ask questions
at various conferences.

Ultimately, this led John to partner with Egghead.io co-founder, Joel Hooks.
Between the two of them, Joel and John have built their website from the ground
up, hired a team, networked, and have continued to provide valuable learning
materials to users looking to kick-start their developer careers.

When asked about the nature of collaboration, John acknowledges the differences
between working solo versus working with a team. He adamantly believes that both
have their benefits, but that collaboration in nature has a uniquely human
quality: connection. John shares his process for working with new instructors
and how he helps them zero in on what it is they wish to teach and what action
steps they need to take to achieve their goals. John concludes today’s episode
by discussing his exciting new project in automation.

Through collaboration, John has been able to use CodeSandbox to help enhance
Egghead.io itself as well as to help enhance the experiences of those just
starting out within the company. To further connect with CodeSandbox and to keep
