## CodeSandbox CI

Maintaining open source projects, while enormously fulfilling, can be
time-consuming and stressful. After a busy #Hacktoberfest, we know from
first-hand experience what it's like, and we wanted to help library maintainers
make the best use of their time. Today we're pleased to launch CodeSandbox CI: A
free continuous integration service purpose-built for open source library
maintainers.

### Here's how it works

CodeSandbox CI is a GitHub app that auto-builds your library⁠ from pull
requests. Whenever someone opens a new pull request, CodeSandbox CI builds a new
version of your library. Those builds get posted to our registry, so you can
test it in CodeSandbox or locally, and all without having to publish the build
to npm⁠. Plus, if the original GitHub issue contains a link to a reproducible
sandbox, then we'll automatically fork it using the new PR build. That means you
can review it online with one click.

### Used by the biggest names in OSS

After a successful private beta, CodeSandbox CI is already in use by projects
like React, Babel, Framer, Material UI, and others. And it's proving to be a
real time-saver.

**Try it out for yourself by
[installing the GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/codesandbox)**.

## A new look for Embeds

CodeSandbox CI is the latest way maintainers can use CodeSandbox to save time
and improve experiences for users and contributors. But more than 4000 open
source projects already use CodeSandbox embeds in their docs, blog posts, and
websites—providing visitors with working examples that help explain how to use
their creations.

Embeds provide the ability to view a sandbox inline in your content, whether you
want to show the code, the running app, or both at the same time. Our embeds use
a specially designed version of CodeSandbox that's small in size but almost as
powerful as the full thing, making for a great way to explain a coding concept
or show off a demo.

We want you to be able to use embeds anywhere you want. So based on feedback
from our community, we've launched a new default look and feel for embeds that's
minimal in design and looks great wherever you place it. With a subtle color
palette and no branding, it doesn't take the focus away from your great content.

Danny Ruchtie, Head of Design here at CodeSandbox, notes that with this release,
_“we've focused on building something that would better blend in with its
surroundings while maintaining all its powerful features. So there's less focus
on the UI and more on the content. We also wanted to give users more control and
improve the embed experience on mobile.”_

### The next big design trend?

Ahead of the hipster crowd and the recent dark mode trend (we've had a default
dark theme since we started!), we're pleased to introduce what's sure to be the
next big thing in web design: light mode!

Seriously though, while black's our go-to, we appreciate it doesn't always work
for some site designs. So we've added a new white-based theme for embeds, which
you can toggle on when creating an embed from the Share menu in the editor.

The new design is already live, so check it out and take a look at
[our docs](https://codesandbox.io/docs/embedding) for more info.

### Get more done

With embeds, and now CodeSandbox CI, we're giving open-source project
maintainers new ways to reduce their support overhead and get more done.
Available now, CodeSandbox CI makes it possible to test fixes without the need
to clone, install, and check things locally. There’s more info about how to
configure CodeSandbox CI in [our docs](/docs/ci), and you can get started by
[installing the GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/codesandbox).
