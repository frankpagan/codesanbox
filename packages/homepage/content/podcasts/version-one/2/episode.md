Tune in to this episode Version One, a podcast about the product development
journey from the makers behind some of the web’s most talked about tools and
resources. Host Maurice Cherry introduces the main driver and passion behind the
Vercel platform—Guillermo Rauch. Guillermo created Vercel after years of
passionate work in the computer and software industry. Find out the experiences,
technologies, and challenges that gave birth to this unique platform.

Maurice gets the conversation started with a background on Guillermo’s early
interest in computers and the developing world of technology. Guillermo shares
about the itch he always had in wondering what more could be done with the
pieces he had. Learn about the challenges he faced in Argentina and the unique
steps he took in overcoming these. Downloading Linux proved to be a pivotal
moment in Guillermo’s journey with open source, literally opening up to him a
new world for developing.

Through web forums, Guillermo realized his need for community to succeed and
figure things out. DataFull, a stock overflow website, and his obsession to be
top on their leaderboard as pre-teen drove him to new levels. Guillermo quickly
found his niche in answering all-things concerning Linux. As his online
networking and friendships grew, he was introduced to a new world of work via
the web, where he could get paid for small CSS fixes. Guillermo quickly starting
taking on more projects and making money through these side gigs, until the
milestone moment he faced as a 17-year-old with a job offer from Facebook. The
tensions of website work and his education collided, leading to his dropping out
of school altogether. Learn how this man continued moving up in the industry,
without ever obtaining a high school or college diploma! Maurice continues
tracing Guillermo’s journey as he moved abroad for jobs—the first being a
Switzerland start-up. No longer working on side jobs, Guillermo found himself
joining a team full time. Passion drove him, and his work spoke for itself.

The conversation dives into the details of Guillermo’s passion, along with his
growing obsession with the power of JavaScript. Guillermo pivoted from his
LearnBoost start-up, to working on real time sharing with creating
Cloudup—utilizing hyperlinks for expedited sharing. Listen to his story about
meeting the founder of WordPress and how they discussed the incorporation of
JavaScript. Guillermo was always itching more. Laying foundation for deploying
and building initiatives, his experiences led to the creation of Vercel.

The episode draws to a close as we hear about the anxiety that pressed Guillermo
into functional programming to be apart of the discovery and revolution he saw
on the horizon. Vercel’s name reflects the performance and agility values behind
the brand. Guillermo wanted to create an entry point that wasn’t granular, and
this product proved to be the crossroads of his inspirations. Nothing was taken
for granted. Guillermo emphasizes that success does not come in just one key
paradigm, but rather in taking on a “customer obsessive” mentality in order to
bring (or create) the best possible solutions to people!
